I am going to give you instructions divided into sections. Each section is titled with a ###SECTION_NAME### and refers to an important aspect of the prompt that you must consider when you elaborate your answer.

###OPTIMIZATION_ENGINE_PARAMETERS###
These are the input parameters of an optimization engine that solves a manufacturing system problem, including the initial values and the meanings of the parameters.
Each entry in the list below must be interpreted according to the following schema:
"# VARIABLE_SCOPE | DESCRIPTION | VARIABLE_TYPE | VARIABLE_RANGE, CONSTRAINTS or GUIDELINES #" (this provides further explanation about the variable)
VARIABLE_NAME = VARIABLE_VALUE (this represents the variable setting)

<json>
{
    "value": "model_python",
    "options": {
        "model_python": {
            "type": "file",
            "value": "${SESSION_DIRECTORY}/fc_model_specification.csv",
            "format": "python_model"
        }
    }
}
</json>

###STRATEGY_OPTIONS###
<json>
{
    "value": "strategy_options",
    "options": {
        "strategy_options": {
            "type": "file",
            "value": "knowledge_base/strategy_options.json",
            "format": "json"
        }
    }
}
</json>

###SCENARIO###
<json>
{
    "value": "input",
    "options": {
        "input": {
            "type": "file",
            "value": "${SESSION_DIRECTORY}/scenario.txt"
        }
    }
}
</json>

###YOUR_TASK###
If you are given enough information, you must suggest one or more strategies suitable to achieve the directives reported in the ###EVENT### and ###OBJECTIVE### sections, or point out any insufficiencies or contradictions in the input information required for doing so.

Firstly, you have to select an option, based on its description and the information provided in the ###SCENARIO### section, for each block defined inside the ###STRATEGY_OPTIONS### section. The available options are listed under the "options" field along with their description. When selecting an option, make sure to include all fields listed under that option.
Secondly, if the chosen strategy option contains a variable indicated by ${...}, you have to define its value (in case of indexes make sure to count from 0), that comply with the instructions contained in the ###SCENARIO### section.
Remember, a valid strategy is a combination of blocks contained in the ###STRATEGY_OPTIONS### section, only. You must choose only one option from each block in the ###STRATEGY_OPTIONS###.

If something cannot be determined based solely on the given information, do not make assumptions to continue the thought process.

###TASK_OUTPUT_FORMAT###
You must provide the requested strategies in JSON format, with the same structure as in the ###STRATEGY_OPTIONS### section:
```json
{
    "<strategy_component>": {
        "description": "<component_description>"
        "options": {
            "<option_letter>": {
                "description": "<option_description>"
                "parameter_values": "<parameter_values>"
            }
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

###TASK_OUTPUT_EXPLANATION###
It contains a step-by-step explanation/summarization of your response. If something cannot be determined based solely on the given information, do not make assumptions to continue the thought process.

###TASK_INSUFFICIENT_INFO###
Verify whether the reasoning performed in ###TASK_OUTPUT_EXPLANATION### is logically based on the given information. If any assumptions have been made using information not provided, explain what additional information is needed.

###TASK_OUTPUT###
Here you have to produce the answer to ###YOUR_TASK###, considering ALL the directives included in the previous sections, and structured according to the ###TASK_OUTPUT_FORMAT###.

Your final output must be structured as follows (in this order):
###TASK_OUTPUT###
###TASK_OUTPUT_EXPLANATION###
###TASK_INSUFFICIENT_INFO###
